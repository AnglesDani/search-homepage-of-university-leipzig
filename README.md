## Modules

This project consists of different modules:
* [search-engine-uni-backend](search-engine-uni-backend)
  * The backend.
* [visualize_events](visualize_events)
  * A small visualization of events that are fired from the backend (like user "XY" searched for "abc" and clicked on result 4)
  * This is only there for testing purposes and reviews.
* [infrastructure](infrastructure)
  * Defines the infrastructure that is required to run the project.
  * Main goal is to give a reproducable (i.e. docker) description of the infrastructure around the backend to deploy everything easily.
* [example_indices](example_indices)
  * Some **small** example indices that you are able to start everything without any further requirements.
